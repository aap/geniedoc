PatternMasks.dat contains some sort of light maps. Its purpose is not yet clear to me,
however the format is very simple:

repeat 40 {
	int size	// always 4096
	uchar data[size];
}

The data can be interpreted as a 64x64 pixel indexed/greyscale image.
The maps seem to be arranged in pairs of two where one is some sort of
complement of the other. This gives 20 pairs.
The purpose is not quite clear to me but it is likely used together with
lightMaps.dat and the texture indices in FilterMaps.dat, which can exactly
index a 64x64 map.

See patternmasks.bmp (arranged in 4x10 however)
