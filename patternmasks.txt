PatternMasks.dat contains lighting textures used to light sloped
terrain tiles. It is used in conjunction with Lightmaps.dat

repeat 40 {
	int size	// always 4096
	uchar data[size];
}

The data can be interpreted as a 64x64 pixel indexed/greyscale image.
The maps seem to be arranged in pairs of two where one is some sort of
complement of the other. This gives 20 pairs.

Every pixel in the 64x64 textures is interpreted as a brightness value and
is used to select one of the lightmaps defined in lightmaps.dat.
The lower two pixels seem to be ignored, so every lightmap corresponds
to 4 brightness values. Valid values are 0-71 and seem to be identical
to 128-199 for some reason. Maybe bit 7 does something?

See patternmasks.bmp (arranged in 4x10 however)
