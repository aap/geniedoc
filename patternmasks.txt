PatternMasks.dat contains lighting textures used to light sloped
terrain tiles. It is used in conjunction with Lightmaps.dat

repeat 40 {
	int size	// always 4096
	uchar data[size];
}

The data can be interpreted as a 64x64 pixel 8 bit image.

Every non-flat tile is lit by multiple patternmasks that depend on slope
type and neighboring slopes types. One patternmask serves as the base with
which the others are combined.
Every pixel in the 64x64 textures is a brightness value (lightmap index) plus
two combination flag bits. For the base pattern the combination flags are ignored.
For all following patterns if bit 0 of a pixel is set, it is ignored. If bit 1
is set, the pixel replaces the current one if it is brighter. If bit 1 is clear,
the pixel replaces the current one if it is darker. Bits 2-7 are the brightness
value. However do note that the uppermost bit is masked off in the end, it is
used with bit 1 to effectively replace any value (it is brighter than any
pixel in the 0-17 range).
