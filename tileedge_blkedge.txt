BlkEdge.dat and TileEdge.dat have the same format. They seem to be used
to mask off pixels of terrain tiles at the end of the explored map and
divide tiles into a visible and fogged part respectively.

The structures in memory are:

struct Edge
{
	Slope *slope[17];
};

struct Slope
{
	Span *tiles[n];	// n = 94 for TileEdge, 47 for BlkEdge
};

struct Span
{
	char y, x0, x1;
};

To read the files, the complete file contents are interpreted as
an Edge struct. All pointers in the above description are stored
as offsets from the beginning of the file and relocated at runtime.

Every tile is made up of a number of scanlines starting at (y, x0)
and ending at (y, x1) (inclusive).
The end of the span array is indicated by y, x0 and x1 being -1;

TileEdge tiles come in pair of two, one being the complement of
the other. Presumable to separate the visible and fogged area.

See blkedge.bmp and tileedge.bmp for a visualisation. The
span areas are marked white.
