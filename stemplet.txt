STemplet.dat contains SLP templates used as a base for sloped terrain tiles.
SLP templates are used to create single frame SLPs. They do not store actual
drawing commands but provide the general structure of an SLP.

In memory an SLP template is stored like this:

struct SlpTemplate
{
	int width;
	int height;
	int centerX;
	int centerY;
	int dataSize;
	short *outlineTbl;	// 2*height elements
	int *cmdOffsetTbl;	// height elements
};

Width, height, centerX and centerY are just copied into the SLP frame header.
DataSize is the size of the drawing command area of the SLP (i.e. it does
not include the SLP header, frame header and both tables).
OutlineTbl and cmdOffsetTbl are the same as their SLP counterparts and are
just copied into the SLP.

When written to a file, both pointers are stored as offsets from the SlpTemplate.

The structure of STemplet.dat is then very simple:

repeat 17 {	// 17 slope types
	int size;
	uchar template[size];
}

Where every template is actually an SlpTemplate (and with offsets instead
of pointers as explained above).

See stemplet.bmp for the shape of the tiles (generated from the outline table).
