LoQMaps.dat is very similar to FilterMaps.dat in both structure and purpose.
It seems to do a lower quality texture mapping than FilterMaps.dat with no
blending and simpler lighting.

The data structures are the same as in FilterMaps.dat, the only difference
are the pixel descriptions (what I called cmds in the FilterMaps documentation).

Every scanline begins with the number of pixels for that line, interestingly stored
as a 4 byte int (only one byte in FilterMaps.dat).
After that every pixel takes 3 bytes, a ushort is again the offset of the source
palette index in the SLP, and the third byte is the index of the ICM used to light
the pixel.

Again, example code:

	uchar *cmd;
	int width;
	ushort pixel;
	uchar icmidx;
	for(i = 0; i < map->height; i++){
		width = *(int*)cmd;
		cmd += 4;
		for(j = 0; j < width; j++){
			pixel = *(ushort*)(cmd);
			icmidx = cmd[2];
			cmd += 3;
			// Do something here
		}
	}
