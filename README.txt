This is a documentation of all .dat files (apart from empires2*.dat) of Age of Empires II
(Age of Kings and The Conquerors).

Most have to do with terrain rendering in one way or the other.

I did not come up with everything by myself. Some files were already documented quite well
by others, some were decoded with the help of Matt Pritchard's description (mainly view_icm)
and the game's code helped too with the general structure and stemplet.dat in particular.
