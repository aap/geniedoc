Lightmaps.dat has basically the same format as PatternMasks.dat,
the only difference is that there are only 18 instead of 40 maps,
and that the indices select an ICM, so are in range 0-8.

The purpose is not quite clear to me. The maps seem to be rather uniform in color
with just a little bit of noise. Probably used together with PatternMasks.dat and
FilterMaps.dat.

See lightmaps.bmp for a visualisation. Since the ICM indices are so
low, I multiplied them with 16 to make them more visible.
