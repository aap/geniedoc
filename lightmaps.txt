Lightmaps.dat has basically the same format as PatternMasks.dat,
the only difference is that there are only 18 instead of 40 maps,
and that the indices select an ICM, so are in range 0-8.

This file is used together with the high quality lighting defined in PatternMasks.dat.
Its purpose is to increase the number of brightness steps from 9 (number of
ICMs) to 17 (the last one is neutral, ICM 4) by dithering them.

See lightmaps.bmp for a visualisation. Since the ICM indices are so
low, I multiplied them with 16 to make them more visible.
